# 2.1 Lottery simulator

Build a lottery simulator with 6 unique numbers with values between 1 and 49. Choose your own numbers and initialize a list like `myNumbers = [1,4,12,15,32,38]`. Create random numbers until you have 6 matches. Count how many times you would have to play the lottery to win once.

Hint: You can sort a list of numbers with `myNumbers.sort()`

# 2.2 Choose your own numbers

Extend your program by asking the user for the numbers in the command line instead of initially defining the array.

# 2.3 Is it worth it?
