## how to solve a problem

If you want to write a function, try to follow these steps:

1. How would you approach the problem without a computer? Maybe even use pen & paper to visualize the problem or do some example calculations
2. Split your approach to solve the problem into small steps, one calculation at a time
3. Write a first function that follows your algorithms, try to solve the problem for the most basic inputs
4. Think of more complex calculations or edge cases in your program and extend your algorithm. Maybe even try to break your program and catch possible sources for errors (wrong user input etc.)
5. Improve your program by efficiency and readability. Avoid usage of duplicate lines of code and write new functions instead

## use variables

While programming don't hesitate to use and declare new variables when you do some calculations. It makes your program easier to read and understand. Try not to use multiple commands in one line unless your confident what you are doing and completely understand it.

## use good names for your variables

For simple iterations you can use short variable names like n or i but keep in mind that it's hard to understand your own code even after a few days. So use good names for your variables so they speak for themself

## comments, comments, comments

Document your code with comments for others and yourself!

## prints

When writing your program and you may run into errors or unexpected results in your calculations.
To better understand what's happening inside your function try to use print commands `print("description", value)` at every critical step in your program.
Later you will learn how to debug your code and run it step by step.
