## Variables

To declare and assign a new variable write `variable_name = value`

## Datatypes

Your variables can have different types

- string
- int
- float
- bool
- list
- tuple
- dict
- set
- none

```python
name = "Hans" # string
age = 71 # int
height = 1.85 # float
isHungry = True # bool
favoriteFoods = ["pizza", "pasta", "sushi"] # list
homeCoordinates = (63.625214, -19.614352) # tuple
pets = {"dog": "Fido", "cat": "Garfield"} # dict
hobbies = {"reading", "hiking", "eating"} # set
isAstronaut = None # none
```

## Print variables

You can print the values of your variables in the console with `print()`. This is also possible for multiple variables at once:

```python
print(name)

print(name, age, height, isHungry, favoriteFoods,
      homeCoordinates, pets, hobbies, isAstronaut)
```
