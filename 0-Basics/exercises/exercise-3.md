### 1. days to seconds

Write a python program which asks you for a number of days and converts the time to seconds.

Example: 560 days are 48384000 seconds

### 2. 7464643 seconds to mars

Ask the user for a number and save it to a variable 'seconds'. Convert this value from seconds to years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.

Example:

Input: 7464643

Output: 7464643 seconds are 0 year(s), 86 day(s), 9 hour(s), 30 minute(s) and 43 second(s).

### 3. Count vowels and create a secure password

Write a program which asks the user for a sentence. Iterate over this string character by character (you can also use a for loop for strings) and count vowels a,e,i.o,u.
In the end print out the number of counted vowels.
To create a high security password with the given sentence create a new string variable and add only the non-vowel characters. If there are whitespaces, replace them with '%'.

Example:

Input: I enjoy learning pyhton with Jakob

Output: 9 vowels, password: I%njy%lrnng%pyhtn%wth%Jkb

### 4 Sum to user number

Ask the user for 2 numbers: x and y
Calculate the sum from 0 to x. Use your code from exercise 2 and adjust it.
Also print out all numbers smaller than x where the division with y is without remainder.

Example:

Input: x=52 y=10

Output:

- division with 10 without remainder: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
- sum from 0 to 52 = 1326

### 5 Factorial

Calculate the factorial number of a number given by the user (n!).

Note 0! is 1

Example:

Input: 5

Output: 5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120
