## Time for your first exercise :)

### 1. In- & Output

Write a simple chatbot which provides a list with the following questions:

```python
chatbot = [
    "How are you? ",
    "What's your name? ",
    "Where do you live? ",
    "How old are you? ",
    "What's your favorite food? ",
]
```

Print out each question to the console and wait for the user input. Save the user's answers in a list and before you exit the program print out all answers.

### 2. Let's go shopping

Henry goes to the supermarket but he forgot his shopping list. Help him with a python program and keep track of his shopping list and his shopping bag. During the conversation save all the changes in his list and answer all his questions with `print()` commands to the command line.
In the beginning his shopping bag and his shopping list are empty:

```python
shopping_bag = []
shopping_list = []
```

Henry: "I am hungry, I'd love to have a pizza and a coke".

He walks to the supermarket.

Henry: "If I remember correctly, I also need Salt and Pepper. Maybe I should also get an apple and a banana to get some vitamins. Speaking of health, I should remove the coke from my list but add orange juice instead. How many items are currently on my shopping list?"

He arrives at the supermarket.

Henry: "Ok, I got the first and the third and the last item on my list and placed them in my shopping bag, so I can remove them from my list. What's still missing?"

He places the last items in his bag but on his way back home he lost the last two items of his bag. What's still in his bag?
