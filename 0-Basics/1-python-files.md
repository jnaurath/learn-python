### Files

use file ending `.py`

### Intendation

Line intendation is important! You don't have to write curly braces `{}`. Use tabs instead of spaces to keep it easy to read.

```python
if x < 10:
    x += 1
```

### Comments

To write comments use either `#` or `'''` for multiline comments

```python
print("Hello World") #comment
'''
This is a
multiline comment
'''
```

### In- & Output

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ") # wait for user input
print(f"Hello, {name}!") #returns value to console

```
